# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

This repo is dead and will continue to be dead. There will only be very few remaining files that are linked to another repository dedicated to everything I will be doing for BetterDiscord (and hopefully more). If you somehow find that your theme is fucked, head over to the Derealised Server (as linked below) to download the new files that are more up to date.

# Quality Themes
Need help with the themes? Visit the [Derealised Server](https://discord.gg/AGmsMpH).

The Phoenix Bundle are forks of old themes that have ceased to be supported. Because I have been maintaining them for a year and have rewritten them to be more readable and efficient, I have renamed them and claimed them as my own.

The code itself is loads different but the output does still look the same.

Black Hole is an original theme that is easier to maintain.

All themes will be hopefully ported to BDv2 soon.
